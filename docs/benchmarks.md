# Benchmarks

Benchmarks for LiteLLM Gateway (Proxy Server) tested against a fake OpenAI endpoint.


LiteLLM Gateway has **8ms P95 latency** at 1k RPS (See benchmarks [here](#4-instances))

## Machine Spec used for testing

Each machine deploying LiteLLM had the following specs:

- 4 CPU
- 8GB RAM

## Configuration

- Database: PostgreSQL. See [Database Sizing](./proxy/db_sizing.md) for how to size yours
- Redis: Not used. Recommended in production; see [Redis Sizing](./proxy/redis_sizing.md)
- Load generator: Locust, 1000 users, each with 0.5s to 1s of think time between requests. See [Locust Settings](#locust-settings) before comparing these numbers against your own run.


### 2 Instance LiteLLM Proxy

In these tests the baseline latency characteristics are measured against a fake-openai-endpoint.

#### Performance Metrics

| **Type** | **Name** | **Median (ms)** | **95%ile (ms)** | **99%ile (ms)** | **Average (ms)** | **Current RPS** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST | /chat/completions | 200 | 630 | 1200 | 262.46 | 1035.7 |
| Custom | LiteLLM Overhead Duration (ms) | 12 | 29 | 43 | 14.74 | 1035.7 |
|  | Aggregated | 100 | 430 | 930 | 138.6 | 2071.4 |

### 4 Instances

| **Type** | **Name** | **Median (ms)** | **95%ile (ms)** | **99%ile (ms)** | **Average (ms)** | **Current RPS** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST | /chat/completions | 100 | 150 | 240 | 111.73 | 1170 |
| Custom | LiteLLM Overhead Duration (ms) | 2 | 8 | 13 | 3.32 | 1170 |
|  | Aggregated | 77 | 130 | 180 | 57.53 | 2340 |

#### Key Findings
- Doubling from 2 to 4 LiteLLM instances halves median latency: 200 ms → 100 ms.
- High-percentile latencies drop significantly: P95 630 ms → 150 ms, P99 1,200 ms → 240 ms.
- Setting workers equal to CPU count gives optimal performance.


## Setting Up Benchmarking with Network Mock

The fastest way to benchmark proxy overhead is using `network_mock` mode. This intercepts outbound requests at the httpx transport layer and returns canned responses, no need for setting up a mock provider. 

**1. Create a proxy config:**

```yaml
model_list:
  - model_name: db-openai-endpoint
    litellm_params:
      model: openai/gpt-4o
      api_key: "sk-fake-key"
      api_base: "https://api.openai.com"

litellm_settings:
  network_mock: true
  callbacks: []
  num_retries: 0
  request_timeout: 30

general_settings:
  master_key: "sk-1234"
```

**2. Start the proxy:**

```bash
litellm --config benchmark_config.yaml --port 4000 --num_workers 8
```

**3. Run the benchmark script:**

```bash
python scripts/benchmark_mock.py --requests 2000 --max-concurrent 200 --runs 3
```

Get the benchmarking script [here](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/blob/main/scripts/benchmark_mock.py)

This measures pure proxy overhead on the hot path without any network latency to a real or fake provider.

## Setting Up a Fake OpenAI Endpoint

For load testing and benchmarking, you can use a fake OpenAI proxy server. LiteLLM provides:

1. **Hosted endpoint**: Use our free hosted fake endpoint at `https://exampleopenaiendpoint-production.up.railway.app/`
2. **Self-hosted**: Set up your own fake OpenAI proxy server using [github.com/BerriAI/example_openai_endpoint](https://github.com/BerriAI/example_openai_endpoint)

Use this config for testing:

```yaml
model_list:
  - model_name: "fake-openai-endpoint"
    litellm_params:
      model: openai/any
      api_base: https://exampleopenaiendpoint-production.up.railway.app/  # or your self-hosted endpoint
      api_key: "test"
```

## Infrastructure Recommendations

The runs above used a single PostgreSQL instance and no Redis, which is a benchmark configuration rather than a production one. For instance sizes at each request rate, the connection math that decides whether a deployment survives a scale-out, and concrete managed-service picks on AWS, Azure, and GCP, see [Database Sizing](./proxy/db_sizing.md) and [Redis Sizing](./proxy/redis_sizing.md). For the gateway-side configuration that goes with it, see [Production Best Practices](./proxy/prod.md).

## Locust Settings

- 1000 Users
- 500 user Ramp Up
- `wait_time = between(0.5, 1)`, so every user sleeps 0.5s to 1s between requests

### Why the think time matters when you reproduce these numbers

A Locust user spends its time either waiting on a response or sleeping. With a 0.75s mean think time and ~110ms responses, each of the 1000 users completes a request about every 0.86s, so the run offers ~1160 RPS and holds roughly **130 requests in flight** at any instant. That in-flight depth, not the user count, is what the latency columns above describe.

A closed-loop client with no think time is measuring something else. 1000 concurrent workers that send the next request the moment the previous one returns hold **1000 requests in flight**, about 8x the queue depth of these runs. Once a gateway is saturated its throughput is fixed, and by Little's Law the latency each client observes is just `requests in flight / throughput`. So the same deployment, at the same RPS, reports roughly 8x the latency purely because the client queued 8x as much work into it. Latency and concurrency are not independent, and neither number means anything without the other.

To compare against the tables above, either keep the 0.5s to 1s think time, or hold your client's in-flight request count near 130 and report it alongside the latency. It is also worth reporting RPS first: if your run shows higher RPS and higher latency than these tables, your gateway is faster than this benchmark and your client is simply queueing deeper.

## How to measure LiteLLM Overhead

All responses from litellm will include the `x-litellm-overhead-duration-ms` header, this is the latency overhead in milliseconds added by LiteLLM Proxy.


If you want to measure this on locust you can use the following code:

```python showLineNumbers title="Locust Code for measuring LiteLLM Overhead"
import os
import uuid
from locust import HttpUser, task, between, events

# Custom metric to track LiteLLM overhead duration
overhead_durations = []

@events.request.add_listener
def on_request(request_type, name, response_time, response_length, response, context, exception, start_time, url, **kwargs):
    if response and hasattr(response, 'headers'):
        overhead_duration = response.headers.get('x-litellm-overhead-duration-ms')
        if overhead_duration:
            try:
                duration_ms = float(overhead_duration)
                overhead_durations.append(duration_ms)
                # Report as custom metric
                events.request.fire(
                    request_type="Custom",
                    name="LiteLLM Overhead Duration (ms)",
                    response_time=duration_ms,
                    response_length=0,
                )
            except (ValueError, TypeError):
                pass

class MyUser(HttpUser):
    wait_time = between(0.5, 1)  # Random wait time between requests

    def on_start(self):
        self.api_key = os.getenv('API_KEY', 'sk-1234567890')
        self.client.headers.update({'Authorization': f'Bearer {self.api_key}'})

    @task
    def litellm_completion(self):
        # no cache hits with this
        payload = {
            "model": "db-openai-endpoint",
            "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": f"{uuid.uuid4()} This is a test there will be no cache hits and we'll fill up the context" * 150}],
            "user": "my-new-end-user-1"
        }
        response = self.client.post("chat/completions", json=payload)
        
        if response.status_code != 200:
            # log the errors in error.txt
            with open("error.txt", "a") as error_log:
                error_log.write(response.text + "\n")
```
