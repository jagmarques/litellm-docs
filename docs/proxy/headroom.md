# Prompt Compression (Headroom)

Headroom is the context optimization layer for LLM applications. It compresses tool outputs, database results, file reads, and RAG payloads before they reach the model, so you get the same answers at a fraction of the tokens.

This is available on both `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/messages` (Anthropic format).

## Architecture

Headroom runs as a sidecar service alongside LiteLLM. Client traffic continues to hit the LiteLLM gateway as usual; LiteLLM calls Headroom in-process during the `pre_call` step to rewrite the messages, then forwards the compressed payload to the upstream LLM. The client and the upstream LLM provider do not talk to Headroom directly.

## Requirements

LiteLLM v1.92.x or later, and a reachable Headroom proxy. See [Deploy Headroom](#deploy-headroom) below for a one-file Dockerfile.

For testing ahead of the stable cut, use the [v1.92.0-dev.1](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/releases/tag/v1.92.0-dev.1) dev release.

## Quick Start

### 1. Define the guardrail in your config

```yaml showLineNumbers title="config.yaml"
model_list:
  - model_name: claude-sonnet-4
    litellm_params:
      model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4
      api_key: os.environ/ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

guardrails:
  - guardrail_name: headroom-compression
    litellm_params:
      guardrail: headroom
      mode: pre_call
      api_base: https://your-headroom-service
#     api_key: os.environ/HEADROOM_API_KEY  [OPTIONAL]
#     default_on: true [OPTIONAL]
```

Only `pre_call` is meaningful; the guardrail is a no-op on responses.

Add `default_on: true` if you want every request through the proxy to be compressed. Leave it off if you want compression to be opt-in (recommended when rolling out to a subset of users or workloads).

### 2. Start the LiteLLM gateway

```shell
litellm --config config.yaml
```

### 3. Send a request

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="OpenAI format" value="openai">

```shell
curl -i http://0.0.0.0:4000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the prior conversation..."}
    ],
    "guardrails": ["headroom-compression"]
  }'
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Anthropic format" value="anthropic">

```shell
curl -i http://0.0.0.0:4000/v1/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4",
    "max_tokens": 1024,
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the prior conversation..."}
    ],
    "litellm_metadata": {"guardrails": ["headroom-compression"]}
  }'
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The messages are sent to the headroom service at `{api_base}/v1/compress` with the JSON body `{"messages": [...], "model": "<model>"}`. The returned `messages` list replaces the request payload before the LLM call.

## Enabling compression per key

When `default_on` is not set, compression runs only for requests that opt in. The typical admin pattern is to attach the guardrail to a virtual key so the developer using the key gets compression automatically, without changing their client code.

Create a key with Headroom attached:

```shell
curl -X POST 'http://0.0.0.0:4000/key/generate' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer sk-1234' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "guardrails": ["headroom-compression"]
      }'
```

Every request made with the returned key will run through `headroom-compression` before reaching the LLM. To attach to an existing key, use `/key/update` with the same `guardrails` field.

## Enabling compression per request

Clients can opt in on a single call without admin involvement.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="OpenAI format" value="openai-perreq">

Pass a `guardrails` array in the request body:

```shell
curl -i http://0.0.0.0:4000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-..." \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4",
    "messages": [...],
    "guardrails": ["headroom-compression"]
  }'
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Anthropic format" value="anthropic-perreq">

`/v1/messages` does not have a top-level `guardrails` field, so opt in via `litellm_metadata`:

```shell
curl -i http://0.0.0.0:4000/v1/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-..." \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4",
    "max_tokens": 1024,
    "messages": [...],
    "litellm_metadata": {"guardrails": ["headroom-compression"]}
  }'
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The response includes an `x-litellm-applied-guardrails: headroom-compression` header so the caller can confirm compression actually ran.

## Claude Code usage

This is the most common rollout: a platform admin wants to cut input token spend for a team that drives heavy traffic through Claude Code without asking each developer to change their setup.

The flow has three steps.

**Admin: register Headroom in `config.yaml`.** Define `headroom-compression` as shown in the Quick Start. Leave `default_on` off so only opted-in keys get compression.

**Admin: issue a per-developer key with Headroom attached.** Each developer gets a virtual key that has the guardrail bound to it.

```shell
curl -X POST 'http://0.0.0.0:4000/key/generate' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer sk-1234' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "key_alias": "claude-code-alice",
        "guardrails": ["headroom-compression"],
        "models": ["claude-sonnet-4"],
        "metadata": {"team": "claude-code-rollout"}
      }'
```

**Developer: point Claude Code at the proxy.** No code change is needed; Claude Code reads `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` and `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` from the environment.

```shell
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="https://your-litellm-proxy.example.com"
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN="sk-the-key-the-admin-issued"

claude
```

From here, every `/v1/messages` request Claude Code makes is compressed by Headroom before being dispatched to Anthropic. The developer sees no behavioral change other than lower token usage on their spend log. To verify compression ran, the admin can inspect `guardrail_information` on the corresponding spend log row, or check the response headers for `x-litellm-applied-guardrails: headroom-compression`.

If a developer wants to skip compression for one request (for example, to compare an uncompressed baseline), they can set the `x-headroom-bypass: true` header on that call.


## Validate Headroom ran

In the Admin UI, open any request in **Logs**, scroll to the **Guardrails & Policy Compliance** panel, and you will see `headroom-compression` listed under **Request Lifecycle** as a `pre-call` step with its latency, plus an entry under **Evaluation Details**.

## Deploy Headroom

Here is the dockerfile for deploying the headroom proxy

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim

RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends build-essential \
    && pip install --no-cache-dir "headroom-ai[proxy]==0.27.0" \
    && apt-get purge -y build-essential \
    && apt-get autoremove -y \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

EXPOSE 8787
ENV HEADROOM_TELEMETRY=off
CMD ["headroom", "proxy", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8787"]
```

### Why `requests_compressed` can be 0

Headroom protects two message types by default, set on the Headroom container itself, not in LiteLLM's `config.yaml`:

- `user`/`system` messages, unless `ENV HEADROOM_COMPRESS_USER_MESSAGES=1` is set. Most Claude Code traffic is `user` role, so a default deployment compresses none of it.
- Messages with an Anthropic `cache_control` marker, always. Compressing them would break prompt-cache byte matching. No override exists.
